But: No way you can walk around after a surgery, the leg needs to lay and rest.

Contact yor travel insurance to find you a nice place where you can rest.

It sucks that your trip is being cut short by a driver’s carelessness;it truly isn’t fair at all. But the reality is that you’re dealing with a really big injury and you need to do the recovery and rehab correctly to avoid giving yourself complications and problems down the track.

You will be dealing with bruising, swelling, pain and tiredness from not being able to walk normally. You’re at higher risk of blood clots and infections for now, too. It’s extra hot with stuff on your leg and it’s a bit nerve-wracking being in big groups/crowded areas… You need to spend a lot of next few weeks with your leg still and elevated, and you really need to avoid getting too sweaty inside your dressings, especially if they’re casting it. 

You need to check out your travel insurance, too. You may lose cover for anything else that happens if you continue to travel, if the doctors recommend returning home. 

I’m sorry, it’s shit.]Upvotes: [121]Comment: [“I am thinking about continuing on crutches”

Ha, no. Your body needs some serious healing time. You need to stay in Italy until you’re well enough to get a plane home. This is a months-long process. Even when surgery is done and the cast is off, you need to re-learn how to use that leg.

Berlin, Prague and Croatia will still be there when you’re ready to go in the future.]Post Name: [Itinerary Help - 70 days in Europe]Post Name: [Itinerary advice for a longer Europe trip]Post Name: [5 days in Namibia]Upvotes: [328]Comment: [What’s in that tree?]Upvotes: [258]Comment: [Is the “no walking after sunset” because of animals?]Upvotes: [107]Comment: [This looks wonderful.

When I’m traveling I’m always prepared that people scream ni hao at me (I’m not Chinese) or stare at me - like you experienced but nothing could prepare me for the racism in Italy.

I was traveling with my white blonde hair blue eyed friend. Everywhere (in Rome) we went I was blatantly ignored. At a restaurant outside the Vatican, they would only take her order then leave before I could place mine. The waiter didn’t even look at me or face me. At the airport , I had the flight info on my phone but they would only address and speak to her. It was one of the worst experiences traveling to be disregarded and ignored. I don’t know what’s wrong with Italian people.

I do have to say, the further south we went the less racism I felt. I had no issues in Sorento and definitely no issues in Sicily.

Hell, it fits all the criteria so hard it even have 1.3 million people.  Not less than 1 million, not more than 1.5.

Not a dead town, not overcrowded.

Not a big downtown, but it has everything you need.  (probably not everything you WANT, but hey)

Due to the small downtown, it's pretty much walkable with decent public transport connecting to main hubs of the city.  Back in my previous visit, riding the light-rail train within the downtown was FREE.  You only need a ticket if you start or end at a out-of-downtown station.

Not a crazy food scene, but it has enough.

Technically not a touristy town, but it does have a tower, a nice mall and a nice park.

Bonus point, reasonably close to one of the most famous national park in the country.
